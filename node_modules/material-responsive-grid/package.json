  "readme": "# Material Responsive Grid #\n\nA grid system that adheres to the [responsive UI](https://material.io/guidelines/layout/responsive-ui.html) standards outlined for Google's [Material Design](https://material.io).  The source consists of [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/) stylesheets that are imported in a specific order and built using [postcss-cli](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-cli).\n\n## Installation ##\n\n```\nnpm i material-responsive-grid --save\n```\n\n## Grid System ##\n\nThere are three basic elements of this grid system: grids, rows, and columns.  \n\n - Rows must be contained by a grid\n - Columns must be contained by a row\n\n\n### Breakpoints ###\n\nThis grid system supports six screen sizes:\n\n- Extra-small (4 columns)\n- Extra-small (8 columns)\n- Small (8 columns)\n- Small\n- Medium\n- Large\n- Extra-Large\n\nThis follows Google's recommendation for [responsive UI breakpoints](https://material.io/guidelines/layout/responsive-ui.html#responsive-ui-breakpoints):\n\n- With the exception of the first three, screen sizes have 12 columns.\n- The gutter is either 16 px or 24 px.  A 24 px gutter is applied when both screen dimensions are greater than or equal to 600 px.\n- Grids will fill the viewport until 1600 px.  At this point, the grid can either: continue to fill the viewport or remain 1600 px wide (left aligned or centered).\n\n### Classes ###\n\nMost classes apply to a particular screen size.  This relationship is designated by the inclusion of the screen size's abbreviation in the class name:\n\n- Extra-small (4 columns): *xs4*\n- Extra-small (8 columns): *xs8*\n- Small (8 columns): *sm8*\n- Small: *sm12* or *sm*\n- Medium: *md12* or *md*\n- Large: *lg12* or *lg*\n- Extra-large: *xl12* or *xl*\n\nFor screen sizes with twelve columns, a duplicate set of classes has been provided that does not include the number of columns in the screen size's abbreviation.\n\n#### Grids ####\n\nGrids have the following classes:\n\n - .grid - The main element that contains rows.  It has a margin applied that will absorb the row's negative left and right margins.\n - .marginless - Eliminates the outer padding that prevents a row's content from spanning edge to edge.\n - .fixed-left - Starting at 1600 px, the grid will be fixed width and left aligned in the viewport.\n - .fixed-center - Starting at 1600 px, the grid will be fixed width and centered horizontally in the viewport.\n - .grid-fixed-left - Deprecated, see *.fixed-left*\n - .grid-fixed-center - Deprecated, see *.fixed-center*\n \nThe default behavior for a grid will be to fill the viewport and preserve outer padding on edge-adjacent columns.\n\n#### Rows ####\n\nRows must be contained by a Grid and have the following classes:\n\n - .row - The element that contains columns.  It uses a negative margin that negates the outer gutter of the first and last columns.\n - .reverse - Reverse direction of this row.\n - .start-{size} - Justify content to the start for the specified sizes (based on direction).\n - .center-{size} - Center content within this row for the specified sizes.\n - .end-{size} - Justify content to the end for the specified sizes (based on direction).\n - .top-{size} - Vertically align content to top for the specified sizes.\n - .middle-{size} - Vertically align content to middle for the specified sizes.\n - .bottom-{size} - Vertically align content to bottom for the specified sizes.\n - .around-{size} - Evenly distribute unused space around columns for the specified sizes.\n - .between-{size} - Evenly distribute unused space between columns for the specified sizes.\n\n#### Columns ####\n\nColumns must be contained by a Row and have the following classes:\n\n - .col-quarter-row - Consumes a quarter of a row for all screen sizes\n - .col-half-row - Consumes half of a row for all screen sizes\n - .col-three-quarter-row - Consumes three-quarters of a row for all screen sizes\n - .col-full-row - Consumes the full row for all screen sizes\n - .col-{size}-{integer, 1-max column count} - Number of columns to consume for a particular screen size\n - .col-{size}-offset-{integer, 0-max column count-1} - Number of columns to offset this column for a particular screen size\n - .first-{size} - Present this column first for a particular screen size (based on row direction)\n - .last-{size} - Present this column last for a particular screen size (based on row direction)\n - .hidden-{size}-only - This column will be hidden for a particular screen size\n - .hidden-{size}-down - This column will be hidden for screens as wide as or narrower than a particular screen size\n - .hidden-{size}-up - This column will be hidden for screens as wide as or wider than a particular screen size\n\n## Example ##\n\n```\n<div class=\"grid\">\n   <div class=\"row\">\n      <div class=\"col-xs4-4 col-lg-6\">\n         <p>This column consumes the entire row for extra-small,\n         small, and medium screens.  For large and extra-large\n         screens, it consumes half of the row.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"hidden-md-down col-half-row\">\n         <p>This column isn't visible for extra-small, small, \n         and medium screens, but is visible for large and \n         extra-large screens.  It consumes half of the row.\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"hidden-sm-down hidden-up-xl col-md-12\">\n         <p>This column is only visible for medium and large\n         screens and consumes the entire row.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"hidden-sm8-only hidden-sm-only hidden-lg-only col-full-row\">\n         <p>This column is hidden for small and large screens\n         and consumes the entire row.</p>\n      </div>\n   </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n## Inspiration ##\n\n- [flexboxgrid](https://github.com/kristoferjoseph/flexboxgrid)\n- [bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)\n",
